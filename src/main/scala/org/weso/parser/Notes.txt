Notes on Turtle Parser

I added the possibility that "triples" return an empty list. 
However, the grammar productions: 

[2]	statement	::=	directive | triples '.'
[6]	triples	::=	subject predicateObjectList 
              | blankNodePropertyList predicateObjectList?

does not seem to allow empty triples...
