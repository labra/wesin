Web Semantics Library in Scala

This repository contains several tools to work with RDF in Scala

* A Turtle Parser that conforms to W3c RDF 1.1 tests based on Scala Parser Combinators
* An inductive representation of RDF graphs
* A simple Jena to Scala mapper
* This library is used by [ShExcala](http://labra.github.io/shexcala), an RDF validator using Shape Expressions

[Banana-RDF](https://github.com/w3c/banana-rdf) contains a more general library to work with RDF from Scala. 
It allows different underlying implementations like Jena and Sesame. 
A long term project will be to unify our work with that library.
